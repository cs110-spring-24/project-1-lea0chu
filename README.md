# Project 1

Notes Authentication

## Description

This project is a simple authentication system for a notes application. Users will be asked to login to the system when the program starts. Users will enter their username and password. The program will encrypt the password and compare it to an encrypted password stored on the system.

Upon logging in, the user will be prompted with a menu allowing the user to enter the following commands:

1. `add` - Add a note
2. `remove` - Remove a note
3. `view` - View a note
4. `list` - List all notes
5. `exit` - Exit the program

The user will be prompted to enter a number corresponding to their option. If the user enters an invalid option, the program will print out an error message and continue to ask the user to enter a value until they enter a valid number.

As we haven't talked about certain topics yet, such as storing multiple types of data, this project will not include the core functionality of the notes yet. The idea is to have a working authentication for a user, along with a functional structure setup for the overarching project.

## Topics
